# Overview

The word [Mimisbrunnr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%ADmisbrunnr) is [Mimir's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%ADmir) Well that nourishes the world tree [Yddrasil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil).  It is used here to make a metaphor with the pooling of knowledge symbolized by various decentralized science projects that managed to tokenize their offerings. "Mims" is minted when a desci token/weth uniswap v3 token LP is sold to the protocol.  Mimisbrunnr merges the liquidity into its own positions and keeps tally.  a user who owns mims can use them as a normal erc20, or unwrap them.  When the unwrap function is called Mimisbrunnr the smart contract sells some liquidity in each pool and sends these tokens back to the user. 
## How does it fund Obsidian-Desci

Then a mim is unwrapped, it decreases the liquidity positions owned by the smart contract, this releases funds to be collected.  However, when the collect function is called, it has not only the funds released, but also the liquidity rewards, the user gets the released funds, but obsidian desci keeps the lp rewards.

## Why Should I hold Mims

Mimisbrunnr is a way to attain broad asset exposure to the desci ecosystem by just holding a single asset.
